; PlatformIO Project Configuration File
;
; BranchController can be built in release or debug mode.
; Choose one to build in the VS Code GUI by editing [platformio]default_envs.
; Release mode is highly optimized. Debug mode is not.
; Release mode will not write debugging information to the serial port;
; it will be assumed you don't have one.
; Throughout the code, use #ifdef DEBUG or #ifdef RELEASE if you need
; to distinguish.
;
;
;   Build options: build flags, source filter, extra scripting
;   Upload options: custom port, speed and extra flags
;   Library options: dependencies, extra library storages
;
; Please visit documentation for the other options and examples
; http://docs.platformio.org/page/projectconf.html
